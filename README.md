Send your computer chess analysis to web, in realtime!

About
-----

Have you ever thought about sharing your computer's analysis on the web, so that others could comment easily?

Yep, this project will help you do that, in a easy way.

1. Install a client (currently on **Linux** only, plan to port to Windows soon!)
2. Open your browser
3. Load game on web and watch your computer comment it on the browser lively!
4. Share it!

Some chess site offer server-based computer analysis. I think it's useless, since the server has limited 
resources to run chess engine.

Why not using your own computer?! Which is much more powerful than the server one!

And then, publish on the web, socialize it!

Installation
---

  1. make
  2. python src/main.py

(Note that the main program is a prototype now. Will be mature in a week or so.)
